# Luen

> Luen is an iOS health app that tracks VO2 Max and Resting Heart Rate using Apple Watch data. It connects cardiovascular fitness metrics to four daily habits - exercise, sleep, daylight, and stress - with zero manual input. All processing happens on-device.

## Key Facts

- Category: Health & Fitness iOS App
- Platform: iPhone with Apple Watch
- Price: One-time purchase (no subscription)
- Privacy: 100% on-device processing, no data leaves the device, no account required
- Developer: Willi Wiedergold
- Website: https://luen.app
- App Store: https://apps.apple.com/app/luen/id6758587026

## What Luen Tracks

### Output Metrics (Cardiovascular Fitness)
- VO2 Max with percentile rankings by age and sex
- Resting Heart Rate with trends over time
- Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

### Input Habits (Tracked Automatically)
- Exercise / Workouts
- Sleep duration and quality
- Daylight exposure
- Stress levels

## How It Works

1. User grants Luen read-only access to Apple Health
2. Apple Watch passively captures health data throughout the day
3. Luen analyzes the relationship between daily habits and cardiovascular metrics
4. Users see patterns and connections in their own data - no generic advice

## Key Differentiators

- No manual logging or data entry required
- No coaching, gamification, or nagging
- No accounts, social features, or ads
- Data never leaves the device (no cloud sync)
- Read-only access to Apple Health (never writes or modifies)
- Shows correlations between habits and fitness outcomes from the user's own data
