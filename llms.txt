## What Luen Does

Luen is designed for people who want to understand their cardiovascular fitness without the noise of gamified health apps. It reads Apple Watch data passively and shows how daily habits (exercise, sleep, daylight, stress) relate to long-term fitness markers (VO2 Max, Resting Heart Rate). There is nothing to log and no manual input. You live your life, and Luen shows you what your body thinks about it.

### Output Metrics (Cardiovascular Fitness)
- VO2 Max with percentile rankings by age and sex
- Resting Heart Rate with trends over time
- Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

### Input Habits (Tracked Automatically via Apple Watch)
- Exercise / Workouts
- Sleep duration and quality
- Daylight exposure
- Stress levels

## Who Luen Is For
