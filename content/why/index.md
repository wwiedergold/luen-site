Modern life is quietly dismantling your health. You sit all day, sleep too little, rarely see sunlight, and carry stress that never resolves. None of this hurts - until it does. The cruelest thing about declining health is that you don't feel it happening. The feedback loop is broken. By the time you notice, years have passed.

But your body has been keeping score the entire time.

<div class="section-break"><span>The Scorecard</span></div>

**VO2 Max** and **Resting Heart Rate** are among the strongest reflections of cardiovascular fitness - which itself is among the strongest predictors of how long and how well you will live. They don't cause longevity. They reflect whether you're living in a way that produces it. Think of them as a mirror, not a medicine.

<div class="section-break"><span>The Habits</span></div>

Longevity isn't built by one heroic decision. It's built by four ordinary ones, repeated daily. **Move your body.** Exercise is the single highest-leverage input for cardiovascular health. **Sleep well.** Without recovery, nothing adapts. **Get sunlight.** Your biology evolved outdoors - circadian rhythm, vitamin D, blood pressure regulation, immune function all depend on it. Avoiding sunlight is a mortality risk factor comparable to smoking. **Manage your stress.** Chronic stress silently elevates your heart rate, suppresses recovery, drives inflammation, and degrades sleep.

These four are not everything that matters. Nutrition matters. Social connection matters. But these are the four highest-leverage habits you can measure passively and consistently - and a system only works if you actually use it.

<div class="section-break"><span>The Instrument</span></div>

Luen doesn't coach you. It doesn't gamify your health. It doesn't ask you to log anything. It reads signals your body is already producing - through the watch on your wrist - and makes the invisible visible. You live your life. Luen shows you what your body thinks about it.

<div class="pull">The problem was never motivation. The problem was that you couldn't see the consequences of your choices - until now.</div>

Once you see the connection between what you do today and how your body responds tomorrow, you don't need an app to nag you. You have something better. Clarity.

<div class="footnote">
    Luen tracks VO2 Max, Resting Heart Rate, and HRV as output metrics, alongside four daily habits - exercise, sleep, daylight, and stress - using Apple Health data. No manual input. No accounts. Your data stays on your device.
