## Privacy Policy

<span class="date-badge">Last updated February 1, 2026</span>

### Overview

Luen is designed with privacy at its core. Your health data never leaves your device. We do not collect, transmit, store, or share any personal or health information.

### Data We Access

Luen reads the following data from Apple Health, with your explicit permission:

- VO2 Max
- Resting Heart Rate
- Heart Rate
- Heart Rate Variability (HRV)
- Sleep Analysis
- Workouts
- Time in Daylight
- Date of Birth
- Biological Sex

### How We Use Your Data

All data is processed locally on your device to:

- Show your fitness metrics and percentile rankings
- Track daily habit progress
- Generate personalised insights about correlations between your habits and fitness
- Display weekly summaries and trends

### Data Storage

All app data is stored locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework. No data is sent to external servers, cloud services, or third parties. There is no account system and no remote database.

### Third-Party Services

Luen does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, tracking, or data collection services. There are no SDKs from external companies in the app.

### Data Sharing

We do not share, sell, rent, or disclose any of your data to anyone. Period.

### Health Data

In accordance with Apple's guidelines, health data accessed through HealthKit is never used for advertising, marketing, or data mining purposes. Luen reads from Apple Health but never writes to it.

### Children's Privacy

Luen is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.

### Data Retention and Deletion

Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have full control. Deleting the app removes all Luen data from your device. You can also revoke Health access at any time in Settings > Health > Luen.

### Notifications

Luen may send local notifications for weekly recaps and milestone achievements. These are generated entirely on-device and do not involve any external push notification services. You can disable notifications in the app's settings or in iOS Settings.

### Changes to This Policy

If we update this policy, we will post the revised version on this page with an updated date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.

### Contact

If you have questions about this privacy policy or your data, please contact us at [our support page](/support/) or email [support@luen.app](mailto:support@luen.app).
