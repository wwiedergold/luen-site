faq:
  - question: "What is a good cardio fitness score?"
    answer: "It depends on your age and sex. Generally, a VO2 Max above the 60th percentile for your demographic is considered good. For specific numbers, see the VO2 Max by age and gender chart."
  - question: "Is cardio fitness the same as VO2 Max?"
    answer: "Yes. Cardio fitness is Apple's consumer-friendly term for VO2 Max. Both measure the maximum amount of oxygen your body can use during exercise, expressed in ml/kg/min."
  - question: "Can you improve cardio fitness at any age?"
    answer: "Yes. Research shows meaningful improvement is possible at every age through consistent aerobic exercise. Beginners see the fastest gains, but even fit individuals in their 60s and 70s can make progress with regular training."

Cardio fitness is your body's ability to deliver and use oxygen during sustained physical activity. It is measured by VO2 Max, the maximum volume of oxygen you can consume per minute relative to your body weight (ml/kg/min). A higher cardio fitness level means your heart, lungs, and muscles work more efficiently together. It is one of the most important markers of overall health.

## Cardio Fitness vs VO2 Max

They are the same thing expressed differently. Apple calls it "Cardio Fitness" in the Health app. The underlying measurement is VO2 Max. Fitbit calls it "Cardio Fitness Score." Garmin just says "VO2 Max." All refer to the same concept: your aerobic capacity, how much oxygen your body can use at peak effort.

The terminology varies by platform, but the science is identical. When your Apple Watch shows a [cardio fitness level](/learn/apple-watch-vo2-max-accuracy/), it is estimating your VO2 Max using heart rate and motion data from outdoor workouts.

## Why It Matters More Than You Think

VO2 Max is one of the strongest predictors of all-cause mortality. A 2018 Cleveland Clinic study of over 122,000 patients found that cardio fitness was more strongly associated with survival than nearly any other modifiable risk factor, including smoking status and blood pressure. The relationship was dose-dependent: higher fitness at any age was associated with [longer lifespan](/learn/vo2-max-and-longevity/), with no observed upper limit to the benefit.

The practical takeaway is straightforward. Improving your cardio fitness, even modestly, is one of the most impactful things you can do for your long-term health. Moving from the bottom 25% to the 25th-50th percentile carries a larger mortality reduction than many common medical interventions.

Specific VO2 Max numbers vary by age and sex. A "Good" score for a 30-year-old is different from a "Good" score for a 60-year-old. See the [VO2 Max by age and gender chart](/learn/vo2-max-by-age-and-gender/) for detailed ranges.

## How to Check Yours

Apple Watch estimates your cardio fitness automatically after outdoor walks, runs, and hikes. You can find it in the Health app under Browse > Heart > Cardio Fitness. The reading updates as you accumulate more qualifying outdoor workouts.

[Luen](/) reads this estimate from Apple Health and shows you how it connects to your daily habits: exercise, sleep, daylight, and stress. Instead of a number sitting in the Health app, you get context, your percentile for your age group and the patterns that correlate with changes over time.

If your reading seems [lower than expected](/learn/apple-watch-cardio-fitness-below-average/), make sure you are doing enough outdoor workouts and that you are not measuring immediately after intense indoor exercise. The accuracy of the estimate depends on the quality and quantity of the data your watch collects.
