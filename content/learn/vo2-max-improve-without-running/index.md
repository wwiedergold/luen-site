faq:
  - question: "Can cycling improve VO2 Max as much as running?"
    answer: "Nearly. Studies show cycling produces 80-90% of the VO2 Max gains that running does at equivalent effort. The difference is small and consistency matters far more than which activity you choose."
  - question: "Does Apple Watch track VO2 Max from cycling?"
    answer: "No. Apple Watch only estimates VO2 Max during outdoor walk, run, or hiking workouts. If you primarily cycle, consider doing an occasional outdoor walk or run to get an updated estimate."
  - question: "What is the fastest way to improve VO2 Max without running?"
    answer: "High-intensity interval training on a bike or rowing machine, combined with longer Zone 2 sessions 2-3 times per week. Most people see meaningful improvement within 6-8 weeks of consistent training."

Running is effective for [VO2 Max improvement](/learn/how-to-improve-vo2-max/) but it is not the only way. Cycling, swimming, rowing, and even brisk walking can produce meaningful gains in [cardio fitness](/learn/what-is-cardio-fitness/). The key variables are intensity, duration, and consistency, not the specific activity. If you cannot run, do not like running, or want to protect your joints, you have plenty of options.

## Why Running Gets All the Credit

Running engages more muscle mass than most alternatives, particularly when including the stabilizing muscles of the core and upper body. This larger muscle recruitment means a higher total oxygen demand, which is why studies often show slightly larger VO2 Max gains from running compared to other activities at the same perceived effort.

But the difference is modest. A consistent cyclist or swimmer will outperform an inconsistent runner every time. The best exercise for VO2 Max is the one you will actually do regularly.

Cross-country skiing tops the list because it engages both upper and lower body simultaneously, demanding more oxygen than any other activity. But it is seasonal and location-dependent. For year-round accessibility, cycling, swimming, and rowing are the strongest choices.

## The Minimum Effective Dose

Three sessions per week, 30 minutes each, at an effort where you can talk but not sing comfortably (Zone 2). This is the minimum that produces reliable VO2 Max improvement regardless of the activity you choose. Add one higher-intensity session per week for faster gains. The higher-intensity session might be 4-6 intervals of 3 minutes at hard effort with 2-3 minutes of easy recovery.

This approach works whether you are cycling, swimming, rowing, or walking hills. The physiology is the same: sustained aerobic demand forces cardiovascular adaptation.

## The Apple Watch Caveat

This is an important practical note. [Apple Watch only estimates VO2 Max](/learn/apple-watch-vo2-max-accuracy/) from outdoor walks, runs, and hikes. If you primarily cycle or swim, your Apple Watch VO2 Max reading will not reflect your actual fitness improvement. You are getting fitter even if the number does not update.

If you want your Apple Watch to reflect your gains, consider doing an occasional outdoor brisk walk or light jog to give it fresh data. A 20-minute brisk walk on flat ground at a conversational pace, done when you are fresh, gives Apple Watch a clean signal. Do not worry if the number seems [lower than expected](/learn/apple-watch-cardio-fitness-below-average/) initially. It takes several qualifying workouts for the estimate to stabilize.

[Luen](/) shows you how your exercise frequency connects to your VO2 Max and [resting heart rate](/learn/normal-resting-heart-rate/) trends, regardless of workout type. You can see the improvement even when Apple Watch does not produce a new VO2 Max reading from every session.
