faq:
  - question: "What is a good resting heart rate?"
    answer: "For most adults, 60-80 bpm is typical. Athletes and highly fit individuals often see 40-60 bpm. Lower within the healthy range generally indicates better cardiovascular fitness."
  - question: "What causes a high resting heart rate?"
    answer: "Common causes include stress, poor sleep, dehydration, caffeine, lack of exercise, illness, and certain medications. Chronic elevation above 100 bpm should be discussed with a doctor."
  - question: "How do I measure my resting heart rate accurately?"
    answer: "Measure first thing in the morning while still in bed, after at least 5 minutes of rest. Take multiple readings across several days. Apple Watch automates this by sampling throughout the day during periods of inactivity."

A normal resting heart rate for adults falls between 60 and 100 beats per minute. But "normal" does not mean "optimal." Well-trained individuals typically rest between 40 and 60 bpm, and research suggests that lower resting heart rates within the healthy range are associated with better cardiovascular health and [longer lifespan](/learn/vo2-max-and-longevity/). Use our [resting heart rate percentile calculator](/tools/resting-heart-rate-percentile-calculator/) to see how yours compares to others your age.

## How to Measure It

The most accurate manual measurement is taken first thing in the morning before getting out of bed. Sit or lie still for at least 5 minutes. Place two fingers on your wrist (radial artery) or neck (carotid artery), count the beats for 30 seconds, and multiply by 2. Repeat across several mornings for a reliable baseline.

Apple Watch automates this process. It measures your heart rate throughout the day using optical sensors and calculates your resting heart rate by analyzing readings taken when you have been still and inactive for a sustained period. The value updates daily and is stored in Apple Health.

## What Affects Your Resting Heart Rate

**Fitness level** is the biggest factor. Regular aerobic exercise strengthens the heart, increasing stroke volume so fewer beats are needed per minute. This is why athletes consistently have lower resting heart rates than sedentary individuals. Even moderate exercise 3-4 times per week produces [measurable reductions](/learn/how-to-lower-resting-heart-rate/) over weeks.

**Stress** keeps your sympathetic nervous system activated, holding your heart rate higher. A stressful week at work can push your resting heart rate up by several beats, even without any change in exercise habits.

**Sleep quality** directly influences recovery. Poor sleep disrupts your autonomic nervous system and raises your daytime resting heart rate. Even one bad night can add 3-5 bpm to your [next-day reading](/learn/resting-heart-rate-while-sleeping/).

**Caffeine and medications.** Stimulants temporarily raise heart rate. Beta blockers and some other medications lower it. If you are tracking your trend, factor in any changes to medication or caffeine intake.

**Dehydration and temperature.** Heat and dehydration increase heart rate as your body works harder to cool itself and maintain blood pressure. Seasonal variation in resting heart rate is normal and expected.

## When to Be Concerned

A resting heart rate consistently above 100 bpm (tachycardia) warrants medical attention. So does a rate below 40 bpm if accompanied by symptoms like dizziness, fatigue, or fainting. Many athletes sit at 40-50 bpm without any issues, so context matters. The number alone is less important than how you feel and whether the trend is changing unexpectedly.

## Tracking the Trend

A single resting heart rate reading is a snapshot. It can be skewed by caffeine, a poor night of sleep, or a stressful morning. The trend over days, weeks, and months is what reveals your fitness trajectory and flags potential problems early. Beyond the number itself, your [resting heart rate trends](/learn/apple-watch-resting-heart-rate-trends/) reveal even more about your health.

[Luen](/) tracks your resting heart rate alongside your daily exercise, sleep, daylight, and stress habits. You see not just the number but the patterns that drive it, so you can identify what actually moves your [resting heart rate](/learn/resting-heart-rate-by-age/) in either direction.
