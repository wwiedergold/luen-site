faq:
  - question: "How often does Apple Watch update VO2 Max?"
    answer: "Apple Watch doesn't update VO2 Max on a fixed schedule. It generates a new estimate after each qualifying outdoor workout — an Outdoor Walk, Run, or Hike of at least 20 minutes on flat terrain (less than 5% grade) with adequate GPS signal, clean heart rate data, and meaningful exertion (approximately 30% heart rate increase above resting)."
  - question: "Why is my Apple Watch VO2 Max not updating?"
    answer: "The most common reasons are: exercising indoors (only outdoor walks, runs, and hikes trigger VO2 Max readings), workouts shorter than 20 minutes, hilly terrain above 5% grade, Power Saving Mode being enabled, or a loose Watch fit causing poor heart rate signal quality. Make sure to do at least one 20+ minute outdoor walk or run on flat ground per week with the Workout app."
  - question: "Does Apple Watch measure VO2 Max during indoor workouts?"
    answer: "No. Apple Watch only estimates VO2 Max during Outdoor Walk, Outdoor Run, and Hiking workouts. Indoor activities like treadmill running, cycling, rowing, or gym sessions do not produce VO2 Max readings because the Watch needs GPS data to calculate your pace relative to heart rate."
  - question: "How long does it take to get a VO2 Max reading on a new Apple Watch?"
    answer: "Apple Watch requires at least 24 hours of wear plus several qualifying outdoor workouts before generating your first VO2 Max estimate. The Watch needs baseline heart rate data and multiple workout samples. Expect 3-7 days of regular outdoor exercise before seeing your initial reading."

Your Apple Watch doesn't update [VO2 Max](/learn/vo2-max-by-age-and-gender/) on a schedule. There's no weekly refresh, no overnight recalculation, no fixed interval. It generates a new estimate after each qualifying outdoor workout — and only when specific conditions are met. If your reading hasn't changed in weeks, it's not because the Watch forgot. It's because you haven't given it the data it needs.

## What triggers a VO2 Max update

Apple Watch estimates VO2 Max during three workout types only: Outdoor Walk, Outdoor Run, and Hiking. No other activity type — not cycling, not swimming, not treadmill, not gym sessions — will produce a reading.

But even the right workout type isn't enough. The Watch also requires:

**At least 20 minutes of continuous activity.** Shorter workouts don't give the algorithm enough data to produce a reliable estimate. Stop-and-go workouts with frequent pauses may also fail to trigger an update.

**Flat or moderate terrain (under 5% grade).** The algorithm needs a clean relationship between your pace and heart rate. Steep hills distort that relationship because your effort increases dramatically without a proportional increase in speed. If you regularly exercise on hilly routes, this alone may explain why your reading rarely updates.

**Adequate GPS signal.** The Watch uses GPS to calculate your pace, which is half of the VO2 Max equation. Poor GPS — from dense tree cover, urban canyons, or tunnels — means unreliable pace data and no update.

**Clean heart rate data.** A loose watch fit, excessive wrist movement, or tattoos under the sensor can all produce noisy heart rate readings. The algorithm discards data it doesn't trust.

**Meaningful exertion.** Apple requires approximately a 30% increase in heart rate above your [resting heart rate](/learn/resting-heart-rate-by-age/) during the workout. A very casual stroll may not push your heart rate high enough to trigger a reading.

## Why your VO2 Max stopped updating

If your reading has been stuck for weeks or months, one of these scenarios is almost certainly the cause:

### You only exercise indoors

This is the most common reason. If your primary exercise is treadmill running, indoor cycling, weight training, or any gym-based workout, your Apple Watch has no qualifying data to estimate VO2 Max. Your reading is stale — it's the last estimate from whenever you last did a qualifying outdoor workout.

### Your workouts are too short

Quick 10-15 minute walks or runs don't meet the 20-minute minimum. Even if you're outdoors and on flat ground, the Watch needs enough continuous data to produce a reliable estimate.

### You're on hilly terrain

If your neighborhood or usual route has significant elevation changes, the Watch may be discarding most of your workouts. Anything above a 5% grade makes the pace-to-heart-rate calculation unreliable, so the algorithm skips it.

### Power Saving Mode is on

When Power Saving Mode is enabled during workouts, the Watch disables the heart rate sensor to conserve battery. No heart rate data means no VO2 Max estimate. Check Settings → Workout → Power Saving Mode on your Apple Watch and make sure it's turned off.

### You're not using the Workout app

Apple Watch can detect outdoor walks automatically, but it's more reliable to start a workout explicitly using the Workout app. Background detection may not always capture enough data for a VO2 Max estimate.

## How to get more frequent readings

If you want your Apple Watch to update VO2 Max regularly, give it what it needs:

**Do at least one qualifying outdoor workout per week.** An [outdoor walk, run, or hike](/learn/how-to-improve-vo2-max/) of at least 20 minutes on flat ground is the simplest way to ensure regular updates. A brisk walk through a flat park is enough — you don't need to run.

**Start the workout explicitly.** Open the Workout app on your Apple Watch and select Outdoor Walk, Outdoor Run, or Hiking before you begin. Don't rely on automatic detection.

**Choose flat routes.** Save the hills for training days when you don't care about getting a reading. For VO2 Max tracking purposes, flat ground produces the most reliable estimates.

**Wear the Watch snugly.** The optical heart rate sensor needs consistent skin contact. A loose band introduces noise. Wear it about one finger-width above your wrist bone, snug but not tight.

**Turn off Power Saving Mode.** If battery life is a concern, charge before your workout rather than enabling power saving.

**Don't start outdoor workouts while your heart rate is still elevated** from prior exercise. If you've just finished a gym session and want to walk home, either wait for your heart rate to settle or don't record the walk as a workout. A high heart rate at a slow walking pace will either produce a [misleadingly low estimate](/learn/why-apple-watch-vo2-max-dropped/) or get discarded entirely.

## How long until a new Apple Watch shows VO2 Max

If you just set up a new Apple Watch — or replaced your old one — expect a delay before seeing your first VO2 Max reading. The Watch needs:

- At least 24 hours of wear to establish baseline heart rate data
- Multiple qualifying outdoor workouts over several days
- Enough data to feel confident in its estimate

Most users see their first reading within 3-7 days of regular outdoor exercise. If you only exercise a few times a week, it may take longer.

After a new Watch or watchOS update, the [accuracy of your readings](/learn/apple-watch-vo2-max-accuracy/) may also shift as the new hardware or algorithm calibrates to your specific physiology. Allow 2-3 weeks of consistent outdoor workouts before treating the readings as your stable baseline.

## What the reading actually means

Each VO2 Max update on Apple Watch is a submaximal estimate — not a direct measurement of your peak oxygen uptake. It's a prediction based on how efficiently your cardiovascular system responds to moderate exertion. The number itself may not match a lab test exactly, but the trend over weeks and months reliably reflects whether your [cardio fitness](/learn/what-is-cardio-fitness/) is improving, stable, or declining.

A single reading is a data point. The pattern across many readings is the signal. Focus on the trend, not any individual number.

This is exactly what [Luen](/) is built to show you. It connects your VO2 Max trend to the daily habits that drive it — workouts, sleep, daylight, and stress — so you can see what's actually moving the needle. No logging required. Your Apple Watch data tells the story.
