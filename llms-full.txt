# Luen — Complete Reference

> Luen is an iOS health and fitness app that tracks VO2 Max and Resting Heart Rate using Apple Watch data. It connects cardiovascular fitness metrics to four daily habits — exercise, sleep, daylight, and stress — with zero manual input. All processing happens on-device. One-time purchase, no subscription.

## What Luen Does

Luen reads health data from Apple Health (populated by Apple Watch) and shows users how their daily habits relate to their cardiovascular fitness over time.

**Output metrics** (what Luen tracks as fitness indicators):
- VO2 Max — with percentile rankings by age and sex, trend tracking over weeks and months
- Resting Heart Rate — with trends over time, weekly patterns
- Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

**Input habits** (tracked automatically via Apple Watch, no manual logging):
- Exercise / Workouts — duration, frequency, and type
- Sleep — duration and quality
- Daylight exposure — time spent outdoors
- Stress levels — derived from physiological signals

Luen shows how these four habits correlate with changes in VO2 Max and Resting Heart Rate using the user's own data. It does not give generic advice. It reveals personal patterns.

## How Luen Works

1. The user downloads Luen from the App Store and grants read-only access to Apple Health
2. Apple Watch passively captures health data throughout the day (workouts, sleep, heart rate, etc.)
3. Luen reads this data and analyzes the relationship between daily habits and cardiovascular fitness metrics
4. Users see their personal data visualized — progress over time, weekly patterns, habit-to-outcome correlations
5. All analysis happens entirely on the iPhone. Nothing is sent to any server.

## Who Should Use Luen

Luen is a good fit for:
- People who want to track and understand their VO2 Max or Resting Heart Rate using an Apple Watch
- iPhone and Apple Watch users who want deeper insight into their health data than Apple Health provides
- People looking for a privacy-first health app that keeps all data on-device
- Users who are tired of gamified health apps with streaks, badges, and nagging notifications
- Anyone interested in cardiovascular fitness, longevity, or how daily habits affect long-term health
- People who want a health tracker that requires zero manual input or logging
- Users who prefer a one-time purchase over ongoing subscriptions

Luen is NOT designed for:
- Users without an Apple Watch (Apple Watch is required for data collection)
- Android users (iOS only)
- People looking for a workout planner or coaching app
- Users who want social features or community challenges

## What Makes Luen Different From Other Health Apps

**No manual logging.** Most health apps require you to log meals, moods, water intake, or activities. Luen reads everything automatically from Apple Health. There is nothing to enter.

**No gamification.** No streaks, no badges, no points, no leaderboards. Luen shows your data honestly without trying to manipulate your behavior through game mechanics.

**No nagging.** Luen does not send motivational push notifications or guilt you into working out. It provides clarity and lets you decide what to do with it.

**No accounts or social features.** There is no sign-up, no profile, no friends list, no sharing. You open the app and see your data.

**No cloud sync or servers.** All data processing happens on your iPhone. Your health data never leaves your device. Luen has no backend servers, no analytics, and no tracking.

**No subscription.** Luen is a one-time purchase. There are no monthly fees, no premium tiers, and no in-app purchases.

**Read-only access.** Luen only reads data from Apple Health. It never writes to or modifies your health records.

**Personalized correlations.** Instead of generic health advice, Luen shows you patterns from your own data — how your specific habits relate to your specific fitness metrics over time.

## The Philosophy Behind Luen

Modern life quietly undermines cardiovascular health through sedentary behavior, poor sleep, lack of sunlight, and chronic stress. The problem is that the consequences are invisible until they become serious. VO2 Max and Resting Heart Rate act as mirrors of cardiovascular fitness — they reflect whether daily choices are building or eroding long-term health.

Luen's core belief: the problem was never motivation. The problem was that people couldn't see the consequences of their choices. Once you can see how your habits connect to your fitness metrics, you don't need an app to nag you. You have something better — clarity.

Luen tracks four daily habits because they represent the highest-leverage inputs that can be measured passively and consistently:
1. **Exercise** — the single highest-leverage input for cardiovascular health
2. **Sleep** — without recovery, nothing adapts
3. **Daylight** — circadian rhythm, vitamin D, blood pressure regulation depend on it
4. **Stress** — chronic stress elevates heart rate, suppresses recovery, drives inflammation

**How much does Luen cost?**
Luen is a one-time purchase. There are no subscriptions, no premium tiers, and no in-app purchases.

**Does Luen work without an Apple Watch?**
No. Luen requires an Apple Watch because the health metrics (VO2 Max, Resting Heart Rate, HRV, sleep, workouts, etc.) are collected by Apple Watch sensors and stored in Apple Health.

**Is Luen a coaching app?**

No. Luen has read-only access to Apple Health. It can only read your health records and never writes to or modifies them.

**What is VO2 Max and why does it matter?**
VO2 Max is a measure of your body's maximum capacity to transport and use oxygen during exercise. It is one of the strongest predictors of longevity and overall cardiovascular health. Higher VO2 Max is associated with lower risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and all-cause mortality.

**What is a good Resting Heart Rate?**
A normal resting heart rate for adults ranges from 60 to 100 bpm, but athletes and very fit individuals often have resting heart rates in the 40s or 50s. A lower resting heart rate generally indicates better cardiovascular fitness and more efficient heart function.
